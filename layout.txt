REFINED (Mini seeq clone)

Functionality:
Upload real-time process data into program using multiple tags
Search those tags to trend data
Detect anomalies within that data and generate reports

Flow:
User uploads CSV file with timestamps and values for individual tags -> insert data into SQLite3 database -> show data

To do:
Build system
Build script to generate pseudo process data
Build script to read data into python

Stack:
Backend - FastAPI (Python)
Frontend - HTMX/HTML/Tailwind/CSS
Database - SQLite
Plotting - Plotly

Current status:
Last updated: 12/09/2025 20:53

Completed:
Wrote functionality to read .csv sample file into SQL database using pandas dataframe
Wrote rudimentary HTMX to receive and pass to /get-tag-id endpoint to fetch data and plot
Wrote fxn to read sql database for tag id and collect data
Passed that data to plotly to create interactive charts
Return plotly as HTML, regenerate all plots each time a tag is queried
Used claude to generate flexbox css
Added dare range changinf functionality
Wrote script to add more datapoints to CSV
Made all of the time manipulation buttons call their own endpoints
Added functionality for buttons to skip to present and oldest points in the data.csv file


Next steps:
Finish timeframe manipulation:
    Skip forward
    Backward
    
Update generate_plots to take in the timeframe and the anchor point to show the correct timeframe

Start adding analysis fxns
