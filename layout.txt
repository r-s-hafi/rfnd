REFINED (Mini seeq clone)

Functionality:
Upload real-time process data into program using multiple tags
Search those tags to trend data
Detect anomalies within that data and generate reports

Flow:
User uploads CSV file with timestamps and values for individual tags -> insert data into SQLite3 database -> show data

To do:
Build system
Build script to generate pseudo process data
Build script to read data into python

Stack:
Backend - FastAPI (Python)
Frontend - HTMX/HTML/Tailwind/CSS
Database - SQLite
Plotting - Plotly

Current status:
Last updated: 12/09/2025 20:53

Completed:
Wrote functionality to read .csv sample file into SQL database using pandas dataframe
Wrote rudimentary HTMX to receive and pass to /get-tag-id endpoint to fetch data and plot
Wrote fxn to read sql database for tag id and collect data
Passed that data to plotly to create interactive charts
Return plotly as HTML, regenerate all plots each time a tag is queried


Next steps:
Setup rudimentary flexbox grid for multiple charts (use ai for this)
Figure out how to keep HTML static for unaffected plots but add/remove new/old ones
Write program to generate CSV with more data
Start adding analysis fxns

Working on:
Sizing the plots to be in an ordered portion of the page
